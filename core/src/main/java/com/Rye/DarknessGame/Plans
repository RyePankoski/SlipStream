Create a list of behaviors that the monster can do, and have the ai manager decide what the monster will do.

The monster can tell the ai manager what it sees, what it wants to do, etc. The ai AIManager can assess these facts and make better decisions for the monster.

This also makes it more readable and expandable.

Probably use a list of booleans
