Power Routing:
    Power is typically routed through walls etc. So sometimes to make a repair you may need to use deployable cables to link parts of the ship to power.
Alien Sabotage:
    Alien can only sabotage "unprotected" repair tasks.
Ship Contexts:
    Ship might exist in different physical spaces.
    The ship may need point defense to protect against asteroids, emc if going through interstellar space at relativistic speeds, orbiting a star (radiation shielding.)
